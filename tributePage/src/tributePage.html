            <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
                <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br> 
                    thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth<br> 
                    Administration"</li><br>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> 
                    Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> 
                    them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>
                <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to<br>
                    budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school<br> 
                    study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent<br> 
                    plants.</li><br>
                <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> 
                    rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,<br> 
                    DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and other applied science.</li><br>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
                <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> 
                    pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology<br> 
                    program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains<br> 
                    of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major<br> 
                    climate on Earth.</li><br>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling<br> 
                    wheat yields</li><br>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> 
                    American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes<br> 
                    on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the<br> 
                    Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a<br> 
                    rapidly expanding population</li><br>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize<br>
                    and sorghum yields</li><br>
                <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."<br> 
                    Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the<br> 
                    demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not<br> 
                    inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants<br> 
                    and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people<br> 
                    were selecting the best breeds."</li><br>    
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
